Legends started with just a few friends and has since scaled much larger. At first, I would use Google Forms to have friends pick their favorite golfers and then we would track who was winning. 
Obviously `=SUM(GolferA1:GolferG1)` became boring within about 7 minutes so I decided to just start plastering data analytics about golfers and how one friend was performing relative to each other. 
To my surprise, friends thought this stuff was pretty interesting. Kind of fun because we can use something that people know (like sports) and the sort of sneak in stats concepts.

I had been wanting to work on web dev skills. I had heard about Supabase from web dev friends so I decided to use that for authentication, and then deployed the whole thing on AWS.
