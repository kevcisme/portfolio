Interviewgineer is a portmanteau of interview and engineer. It's a B2B that is meant for companies who are hoping to hire engineers, data people, and other technical folks. 

After a little customer research, I found that some companies have a desire to hire technical people, but don't always possess the skills to craft great technical interviews.

I made a really easy to deploy solution that creates a live coding environment and a curated set of coding questions for different roles and levels. I sell these at a really reasonable price.
