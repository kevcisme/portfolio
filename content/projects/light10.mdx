Ligh10 is a non-serious project, but I wanted to explore automated content creation. I created a pipeline that generates short form content by scraping reddit, then using text-to-voice in AWS, generates a vocal track.

Because people who are on these platforms have the attention spans of small insects, I put the comments on top of B roll of people playing Minecraft.
