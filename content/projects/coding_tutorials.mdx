Note: I've shut the Jupyter Hub server down for this project.  
Contact me if you're interested in the training materials.

This is a website offering interactive coding tutorials and challenges to help users learn programming languages through practice. 
The idea was to create a hands-on learning environment where users can improve their coding skills by solving challenges. 
This project enhanced my ability to create educational content and interactive web applications.
