Palehuna is a mobile app. It's (fairly) common knowledge that most of our images end up as training data in models. Palehuna protects images from becoming data by shifting the image in subtle ways almost imperceptible to humans.
In doing this, people who post images online - like parents who post pictures of their kids or artists who post pictures of their art-  can protect their images.
